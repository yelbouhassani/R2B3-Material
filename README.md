These are mini-tutorials for visualizing different types of data in Python. We created these to support a data viz course at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Currently we have tutorials for:
- Visualizing geospatial data (using the "Shark Attacks" dataset)
- Visualizing network data (using the "Game of Thrones" social connections dataset)

Please enjoy and let us know if there are any bugs, errors, oversights, etc. Thanks!
